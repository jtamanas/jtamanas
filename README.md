As a member of both Stefano Profumoâ€™s [**SCIPP**][SCIPP] Theory group at UC Santa Cruz and Joseph Hennawiâ€™s [**ENIGMA**][ENIGMA] group at UC Santa Barbara and Leiden Observatory, I work at the intersection of (high energy/astro)physics, deep learning, and statistics.

In my time as a graduate student, Iâ€™ve been lucky enough to work on projects with the worldâ€™s leading experts on applied deep learning. I have worked on deepening (pun intended) the understanding of current theories for a variety of topics: From beyond standard model particle physics, to the structure of the Milky Way, and the cosmological history of the universe.

  
You might know me from my work on:
  
1. [**Simulation-Based Inference**][SaxBI]: Approximate Sequential Bayesian algorithms written in JAX. Used with applications to [high energy physics phenomenology][pMSSM] and future quasar inference work. 
2. [**Via Machinae**][VM]: Unsupervised anomaly detection to discover stellar streams in the Milky Way.
3. [**Spectre**][Spectre]: Approximate Bayesian algorithm for SOTA quasar continuum inference.
